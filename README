The subdirectories contain

core_src: problem-independent source code
prob:* : problem-specific source code.

Typical workflow:

## make and run
#
cd prob:kerr_torus
#
make newrun 
#
# run, leaving some diagnostic info in harm.out
./harm >& harm.out
# ... this takes about 45 min on a mid-2015 macbook pro.
# for a longer run, edit decs.h and change N1 -> 256, N2 -> 256
#
#
## analyze
#
# look at log(density) in x1-x2 coordinates - requires imagemagick
display images/im_logrho_0400.ppm
#
# make a useful imaging program
make rz_image
#
# then make a set of movies - requires ffmpeg
sh ./make_movie.sh
#
# have a look:
vlc images/logrho_rz.mov
# then look at contour plot of log(density) in dump040
./dump.py 40
#
#
## repeat, wiping out data from last run.
#
make newrun
#
## another test case
#
cd ../prob:explosion
#
make
#
./harm >&! harm.out
# ... this takes about 7 min.
# etc...

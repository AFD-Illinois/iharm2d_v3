The subdirectories contain

core_src: problem-independent source code
prob:* : problem-specific source code.

Typical workflow:

## make and run
cd prob:kerr_torus
make newrun 
# run, leaving some diagnostic info in harm.out
./harm >& harm.out
#
## analyze
# look at log(density) in x1-x2 coordinates - requires imagemagick
display images/im_logrho_1000.ppm
# make a useful imaging program
make rz_image
# then make a set of movies - requires ffmpeg
sh ./make_movie.sh
# have a look:
vlc images/logrho_rz.mov
# then look at contour plot of log(density) in dump040
./dump.py 40
#
## repeat, wiping out data from last run.
make newrun
